# news-today
The final project for my Intermediate Web Programming course was to create a CodeIgniter3 PHP application. The application is the website for the fictional news 
reporting company News Today. The site features a Google Maps API, a News Archive page that pulls news stories from a PHPmyadmin relational database, and a contact 
form that uses AJAX to send form data to my email.
